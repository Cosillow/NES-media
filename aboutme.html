        Hi! My name is Natalie Sheehy and I am the founder and owner of NES Media. Looking back, I have always had a fascination with all things cinema- whether it be animation, music videos, movie trailers, or full length feature films, I wanted to know the ins and outs of the industry. In 2016, as a freshman at Bishop Guertin High School in Nashua, NH, I was given a chance to explore this passion. Assigned to create a short video showcasing that showcased my fellow classmates for a school fundraiser, I took the opportunity to teach myself the basics of media production. I soon began watching tutorials online, expanding my grasp of the fundamentals and experimenting with more complex software. 
        
       <div> In 2020, I was gifted my first ever DSLR camera for my high school graduation, and I fell in love with videography and photography as well. That summer, I was hired as a video specialist intern for a small job consulting company where I edited informational shorts that were sold within course packages for customers seeking career advice. After only 3 months, I was promoted to become a Lead Video Specialist, and later the Senior Video Specialist, heading the entire department of young interns. While I greatly appreciated the time I spent in my first internship, I decided it was time to begin creating videos on my own. 
        
       </div> After producing content for friends and family, partnering with small businesses, and building my portfolio over the course of a 10 months, I was given the opportunity to film the wedding of a family- friend. Having the chance to partake in such an important moment and capture special family memories that will live on for years to come gave a new purpose to my work. I rediscovered the value that photographs and videos possess throughout a lifetime, and decided that I wanted to continue to chase the thrill of monumentalizing milestones through media production. 
        
        In addition to videography and photography, I attend the University of Connecticut where I am pursuing a degree in Digital Marketing as well as a minor in Political Science and Spanish. On campus, I am an officer on the Executive Board for Phi Sigma Pi, a co-ed national honors fraternity that promotes scholarship, leadership, and fellowship within universities across the country. I also am a member of UCTV Advertising- an organization at UConn that films, produces, and promotes other student- run clubs and events. When I am not shooting, editing or studying, you can find me with my 7 year old golden retriever, August, and 6 year old yellow labrador, Hannah. 
        
        Today, I collaborate with clients all over New England to create modern and cinematic content that best fits your needs. Whether it be portrait photography, wedding videos, promos, or drone work, NES Media can bring your vision to life.
