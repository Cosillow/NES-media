      <div><p id="description">Hello! My name is Natalie Sheehy and I am an undergraduate student at the University of Connecticut. About 5 years ago, I edited my first ever video for a school project. Since then, I have developed a passion for video production, photography, and all things media! I now work as a freelance photographer and videographer to promote local businesses, create client-specific content, and capture life's most important moments! Born and raised in New Hampshire and currently attending school in Connecticut, I collaborate with clients all around New England.</p></div>
