        Hello! My name is Natalie Sheehy and I am the founder and owner of NES
        Media. Looking back, I have always had
        a fascination with all things cinema- whether it be animation, music
        videos, movie trailers, or full length
        feature films, I wanted to know the ins and outs of the industry.
        Throughout high school, I decided to teach
        myself the basics of media production and by the time I graduated I
        was hired as a video production specialist
        intern at a small employment- consulting company.
      </p>


      <p class="description"> I eventually was promoted to become a Lead Video
        Specialist, and later the Senior Video
        Specialist, heading the entire department of young interns. While I
        greatly appreciated the time I spent in my
        first internship, I decided it was time to start creating videos on my
        own.
      </p>

      <p class="description"> After a few years of producing content for friends
        and family, partnering with small
        businesses, and building my portfolio, I was given the opportunity to
        film the wedding of a family- friend.
        Having the chance to partake in such an important moment gave a new
        purpose to my work and I began
        establishing myself in the wedding industry </p>

      <p class="description"> In addition to videography and photography, I
        attend the University of Connecticut
        where I am pursuing a degree in Finance as well as a minor in Spanish.
        Today, I collaborate with clients all over New England to create
        modern and cinematic content that best
        fits your needs. </p>

          "From beginning to end, she was responsive, easy to get on the phone
          or email/text if we had any
          questions, and she
          laid out her entire process for us so that we understood it and were
          comfortable with everything from the
          start...Fast forward to day of and I don't think I ever saw her
          taking a single break. She was constantly
          on her
          feet, running around, making sure she caught everything. The quality
          is incredibly professional and the
          editing is
          seamless. The teaser video Natalie shared literal days after our
          wedding got so many comments from family
          and
          friends, we even had people telling us that they thought the videos
          looked so professional that they
          could've been a
          trailer for a Hollywood movie. Above all, what we appreciate most is
          that Natalie caught little moments
          and details
          that our photographers weren't quite able to get to (and some that
          are impossible to capture via still
          images). Book
          with Natalie, you will not regret it!""

          "Natalie Natalie Natalie!! She was the BEST! My husband and I
          couldn't have asked for anyone better! She
          was
          extremely professional, and just as kind to not only my husband and
          I but our wedding party and guests
          too."

          "Natalie is very personable, professional, and truly great at what
          she does. She was extremely attentive,
          catching
          every special moment and small detail. We have had effortless
          communication with her throughout the pre and
          post
          wedding process. We could not be more satisfied with the outcome of
          the videos Natalie prepared for us. The
          quality of
          her work and outcome was just what we wished for! It is clear that
          hard work and dedication was used. We
          will cherish
          these videos for the rest of our lives. The moments that were
          captured are so special and invaluable to us.
          We highly
          recommend her to anybody seeking a wedding videographer. Natalie was
          everything we could have asked for, and
          more!
          Thank you so much Natalie!"
