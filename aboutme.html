        Hello! My name is Natalie Sheehy and I am the founder and owner of NES Media. Looking back, I have always had a fascination with all things cinema- whether it be animation, music videos, movie trailers, or full length feature films, I wanted to know the ins and outs of the industry. Throughout high school, I decided to teach myself the basics of media production and by the time I graduated I was hired as a video production specialist intern at a small employment- consulting company.
 </p></div>
 <div><p id="description2">  I eventually was promoted to become a Lead Video Specialist, and later the Senior Video Specialist, heading the entire department of young interns. While I greatly appreciated the time I spent in my first internship, I decided it was time to start creating videos on my own. 
</p>
<div><p id="description3"> After a few years of producing content for friends and family, partnering with small businesses, and building my portfolio, I was given the opportunity to film the wedding of a family- friend. Having the chance to partake in such an important moment gave a new purpose to my work and I began establishing myself in the wedding industry </p>
  <div><p id="description4"> In addition to videography and photography, I attend the University of Connecticut where I am pursuing a degree in Finance as well as a minor in Spanish.
    Today, I collaborate with clients all over New England to create modern and cinematic content that best fits your needs. </p>
